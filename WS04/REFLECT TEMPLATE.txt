In this week’s workshop, I learned more about loops, because like last week’s workshop we also used 
loops for workshop 4. The difference is we added arrays in this week’s 
workshop but the way we do the coding is still the same. 
Workshop 4 taught me how arrays work in a program, what their uses are, and I also
 learned the best use on an array in a program. 
The good thing about using arrays is that you don’t have to manually input the data that you need, you 
can simply declare the data needed in the program, which makes coding so much faster. 
	
Parallel arrays make the stored data easier to view because they are arranged in tabular form. 
In workshop 4, you can easily see the high and low temperatures because they use parallel arrays. 
The only downside that I can see in using parallel arrays is that you have to make sure that the 
spacing for each data is correct because if you fail to fix the spacing, 
the data will be jumbled, which is very confusing. After fixing that tricky part, you’re all good.
I think starting with the number zero (0) is useful because you will never really 
know the output that you will get in loops. 
If you put a number other than zero in your code, it might mess up the code and you might end
 up getting an error. So I think that we should always use zero to avoid confusion.

In the end, I must say that I learned a lot in this workshop. Its really fun when you 
can apply the things that you learn in lectures, 
especially when it’s the part of the lecture that you didn’t understand that much. 
In doing this workshop, I reviewed the things I learned last week in the lectures, 
and that helped me a lot.
