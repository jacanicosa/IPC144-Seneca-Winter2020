//==============================================

In this week, we improved on the struct files we did for milestone 2, but for this 
milestone, we included the struct Contact inside the header file which is a nested
struct since it contains the structs Name, Address, and Number. We also had a
different file that holds the code that takes the user input and it also holds
the if statements, so what's left in the main file, a1ms4.c is the code to display the 
user input.

I think that the assignment made us use the struct Contact because the details in it, like the
contact's name, address, and numbers are information regarding a Contact, so it would be logical 
to put these information inside a structs since they relate to a single person.

It would be poor design to pass a pointer to type Contact as an argument in the functions 
getName, getAddress, and getNumbers because if you do it, you may need to change the parameters
of the code which will cause more problems in the code.
