In this weekâ€™s workshop, I learned how to use structures or 'structs' in our code. It is somehow similar to arrays because it can store alot of data,the difference is that structs store data that are not identical to each other, and group it as a single object, whereas arrays only store one type of data.

The main advantage an array of structs has versus a parallel array is that you can store more data in it, which means that you can reuse data that you stored in the structure if you need it, whereas in arrays, you can only store one data, which makes it trikcy when you want to reuse it for other parts of your code. An example of thi is in the workhop, you can put Employees[i], and ID_Number altogether to make Employee[i].ID_Number, whereas in parallel structs you have to make a new identifier for Employee[i].ID_Number, because parallel arrays cannot store the said data, as it can only store one type of data.

You can also store the Employee struct file in a header file. Header files are used so that we can have a place where we put the code and edit it there, which helps so that other people will not be overwhelmed when they look at the code you input.

Structs are very tricky, I really had a hard time in doing this workshop, but after reading on how one codes a struct and applying the lectures we had on structs, I eventually finished my code, though I think that parallel arrays are easier to do but maybe thats just because im more used to coding parallel arrays than coding structs.
